	The class Iterator<TYPE> iterates the objects inside any collection whose 
		reflective::Type provides an implementation of reflective::ICollectionHandler.
	If the reflective::Type of the collections does not provoide a ICollectionHandler,
		the object is considered an empty collection.

	Iterator<void> \ Iterator<const void> - iterates a collection giving access to
		the current object through a (const) void pointer.
